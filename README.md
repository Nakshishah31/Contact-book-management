The code is a simple Contact Book Management System implemented in 
Java. It allows users to add, search, delete, modify, display, and save 
contacts to a CSV file. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:
1. *Main Class and Scanner Setup*: The `ContactBook` class contains the 
`main` method where the application starts. A `Scanner` object is used to 
read user input.
2. *Main Loop*: A `while` loop keeps the application running until the 
user chooses to exit. Inside the loop, the user is presented with a menu of 
options.
3. *Menu Options*:
 - *Add Contact*: Prompts the user to enter a name and phone number, 
then stores this information in a `HashMap` named `contact`. The 
`saveContactsToCSV` method is called to save the updated contacts to a 
CSV file.
 - *Search Contact*: Asks for a name to search and retrieves the 
corresponding number from the `HashMap`, displaying the result.
 - *Delete Contact*: Requests a name to delete from the contacts. If 
found, the contact is removed from the `HashMap` and the contacts are 
saved to the CSV file again.
 - *Modify Contact*: Prompts the user for a contact name and a new 
number to update the existing contact. The modified contact is then saved 
to the CSV file.
 - *Display Contacts*: Iterates over the `HashMap` and prints all stored 
contacts.
 - *Exit*: Ends the loop and closes the scanner, exiting the application.
4. *Saving to CSV*: The `saveContactsToCSV` method writes the 
contacts from the `HashMap` to a file named `contacts.csv`. Each contact 
is written in a new line in the format "Name,Number". If an error occurs 
during file operations, an exception is caught and an error message is 
printed.
